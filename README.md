# JetOverlay SDK

[![](https://jitpack.io/v/YazanAesmael/JetOverlay.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#YazanAesmael/JetOverlay)

A lightweight, **Jetpack Compose-first** SDK for managing floating Android overlays (System Alert Windows).

JetOverlay handles the complexity of `WindowManager`, `Service` lifecycle, and `Touch Events`, allowing you to render **native Composable content** floating over other apps with just a few lines of code.

## Features

* **Compose First:** Render standard Composable functions as overlays.
* **Built-in Dragging:** Physics-based dragging support out of the box.
* **Architecture Aware:** Each overlay has its own `Lifecycle`, `ViewModelStore`, and `SavedStateRegistry`.
* **Resilient:** Survives process death and restarts automatically via Foreground Service.
* **Customizable:** Full control over notification channels, icons, and text.
* **Safe:** Handles `ConcurrentModificationException` and "Zombie View" scenarios automatically.

## Installation

### Step 1. Add the JitPack repository

In your `settings.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven(url = "[https://jitpack.io](https://jitpack.io)")
    }
}

```

### Step 2. Add the dependency

In your module's `build.gradle.kts` (usually `app/build.gradle.kts`):

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.YazanAesmael:JetOverlay:1.0.0")
}

```

### Option B: Local Integration

If you are integrating this locally (cloned repo), add the `:jetoverlay` module to your `settings.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
include(":jetoverlay")

```

Then add the dependency:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(project(":jetoverlay"))
}

```

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize the SDK

In your `Application` class or `MainActivity.onCreate`, initialize the SDK factory. This tells the SDK **what** to render when an overlay is requested.

```kotlin
class MyApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        
        OverlaySdk.initialize(
            notificationConfig = OverlayNotificationConfig(
                title = "My App Overlay",
                message = "Tap to configure",
                iconResId = R.drawable.ic_my_icon
            )
        ) { modifier, id, payload ->
            // This is your Composable content!
            // 'modifier' handles the dragging logic provided by the SDK.
            
            Box(
                modifier = modifier
                    .size(100.dp)
                    .clip(CircleShape)
                    .background(Color.Red)
            ) {
                Text("Overlay: $id")
            }
        }
    }
}

```

### 2. Request Permission

Overlays require the `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` permission. The SDK does not handle the UI for requesting this, you must do it in your app:

```kotlin
if (!Settings.canDrawOverlays(context)) {
    val intent = Intent(
        Settings.ACTION_MANAGE_OVERLAY_PERMISSION,
        Uri.parse("package:$packageName")
    )
    startActivity(intent)
}

```

### 3. Show an Overlay

Once permission is granted, you can show an overlay from anywhere (Activity, ViewModel, BroadcastReceiver).

```kotlin
OverlaySdk.show(
    context = context,
    config = OverlayConfig(
        id = "score_card_1",
        initialX = 100,
        initialY = 200
    ),
    payload = "Match ID: 12345" // Optional data passed to your factory
)

```

### 4. Hide an Overlay

```kotlin
OverlaySdk.hide("score_card_1")

```

## Advanced Usage

### Using ViewModels

Since each overlay has its own `ViewModelStore`, you can use Hilt or standard ViewModels inside your overlay content securely.

```kotlin
OverlaySdk.initialize { modifier, id, payload ->
    // This ViewModel is scoped to THIS specific overlay window
    val viewModel: MyOverlayViewModel = viewModel() 
    
    MyOverlayScreen(
        viewModel = viewModel,
        modifier = modifier
    )
}

```

### ProGuard / R8

The SDK includes its own `consumer-rules.pro`. You do **not** need to add any manual ProGuard rules to your app. The SDK automatically keeps:

* The Public API (`com.yazan.jetoverlay.api.**`)
* The Service reflection entry points.

## Requirements

* minSdk: 26 (Android 8.0)
* compileSdk: 36
* Kotlin: 2.0+
* Jetpack Compose
